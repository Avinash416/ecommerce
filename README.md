Project Title:

"Ecommerce Flipkart Clone"


Description:

This project looks same as the flipkart but it doesnt have that much functionality as compare to flipkart. This is only for learning purpose.
So the app is based on a simple business logic that every ecommerce site has.
i.e. 1.Sign up to site
     2.login
     3.Browse products
     4.Add to cart
     5.Place order of that product
     6.And theres a dummy payment gateway as well

     So this project is based on MERN technlogy, In front end React is used with material ui for a better feel. And for backend Node.js is used to bulid Api's that fetches and posts data from MongoDb (Atlas) For a communication between frontend and backend Express.js is used and for state preservation REDUX has been used.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
